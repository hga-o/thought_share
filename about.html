        <p>This project was an attempt to provide a safe means of surfacing thoughts and feelings. In Part 1, I created <span>10 individual booklets</span> of a <span>contained thought</span>, which were then shared in a classroom of 12 people. In Part 2, the readers created their own booklet of contained thoughts, using the medium as a vehicle to <span>project their thoughts</span> annonymously. Everyone's (and my) creations are now documented on this webpage as an archive. Feel free to click and view.</p>
